1. Functioning:
    - You have forgotten to provide a reference board while asking for input in the first move as "X".
    - I have modified the `playerMove()` and `computerMove()` functions so that the board will be shown at the beginning of the game no matter who the first player is.  

2. Formatting/Style:
    - The `next` and `break` doesn't require `()` you have mentioned them somewhere as `next()...break()` and somewhere as `next...break`. Else, the formatting looks good.
    - _The parentheses were removed.   _
